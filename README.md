This was a very intriguing project. I found myself stuck trying to create the algorithm. I failed multiples times before researching, and even after looking at different ways and listening to examples, I still couldn't quite get the algorithm right. But now, I am confident in my understanding of algorithms, especially BFS, and how we can use them to model real-world situations to find the shortest path between two things.
